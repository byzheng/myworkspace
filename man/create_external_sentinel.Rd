\usage{
create_external_sentinel(sentinel_path, input_files, metadata = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{sentinel_path}{Path to sentinel file, either relative to project root or absolute}

\item{input_files}{Character vector of input file paths, either relative to project root or absolute}

\item{metadata}{Optional list of additional metadata to store}
}
\description{
Create External Sentinel File with Input Tracking
}
\details{
Tracks external dependencies (HPC jobs, shell scripts, database exports, etc.) using sentinel files.
All paths are resolved relative to the project root using `here::here()`. Absolute paths 
are automatically converted to relative paths for storage, ensuring sentinels work consistently 
across platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac) and different working directories.

All timestamps are stored in UTC to ensure consistency when sentinels are shared across 
machines in different timezones (e.g., Sydney to Brisbane, or across international systems).

Examples of valid calls:
- Relative paths: `create_external_sentinel(".external/job.json", c("data/raw.csv", "params.json"))`
- Absolute paths: `create_external_sentinel("/full/path/.external/job.json", c("/full/path/data/raw.csv"))`
- Mixed: `create_external_sentinel("./external/job.json", "/full/path/data/raw.csv")`

Creates a JSON sentinel file that records:
- Completion timestamp (UTC)
- Input files (stored as relative paths) and their modification times (UTC)
- Optional custom metadata
}

# Using relative paths (recommended)
create_external_sentinel(
  sentinel_path = ".external/job_complete.json",
  input_files = c("data/raw.csv", "params.json"),
  metadata = list(job_id = "12345", nodes = 4)
)
}
