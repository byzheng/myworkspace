\title{Build a path relative to the project root}
\usage{
path_prj(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Path components passed to [base::file.path()].}
}
\value{
A path string relative to [base::getwd()] when possible.
}
\description{
Resolves the root directory differently depending on execution context:
interactive sessions use the active editor file (falling back to
[base::getwd()]), knitr uses the current input document, and
non-interactive runs use `PROJECT_DIR` when available, otherwise the
current project (or workspace when no project is found).
}
