\usage{
get_targets(
  path = c("script", "source", "story"),
  pattern = "^_targets_.*\\\\.R$"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of directories to search for target scripts.
Defaults to `c("script", "source", "story")`.}

\item{pattern}{Character scalar regular expression used to match target
script file names. Defaults to `"^_targets_.*\\.R$"`.}
}
\value{
A combined object created from all objects whose names match
  `"^targets_"` after sourcing matched files.
}
\description{
Recursively finds and sources target definition scripts, then collects all
objects in scope with names beginning with `_targets_` and combines them into
a single vector or list using `c()`.
}
\details{
All matched `targets_*` objects must inherit from class `"tar_target"`.
The function validates this after each sourced file and errors with file
context if any matched object does not. It also errors on duplicate
internal target names. If sourcing a matched file fails, the function
rethrows with the source file path.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
dir.create("script")
writeLines("targets_example <- list(a = 1)", "script/_targets_example.R")
get_targets(path = "script")
