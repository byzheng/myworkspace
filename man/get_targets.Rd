\usage{
get_targets(
  path = c("script", "source", "story"),
  pattern = "^_targets_.*\\\\.R$"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of directories to search for target scripts.
Defaults to `c("script", "source", "story")`.}

\item{pattern}{Character scalar regular expression used to match target
script file names. Defaults to `"^_targets_.*\\.R$"`.}
}
\value{
A combined object created from all objects whose names match
  `"^targets_"` after sourcing matched files, plus any tar_target objects
  created as the final expression in sourced files (even if not assigned).
}
\description{
Recursively finds and sources target definition scripts, then collects all
objects in scope with names beginning with `_targets_` and combines them into
a single vector or list using `c()`.
}
\details{
All matched `targets_*` objects must be either:
\itemize{
  \item A single object inheriting from class `"tar_target"`, OR
  \item A list where all elements inherit from class `"tar_target"`
}
Alternatively, a file can contain a bare tar_target call (e.g., 
`targets::tar_target(alpha, 1)`) as its final expression, which will be
captured and named after its internal target name.
The function validates this after each sourced file and errors with file
context if any matched object does not meet these criteria. It also errors on
duplicate internal target names. If sourcing a matched file fails, the
function rethrows with the source file path.
